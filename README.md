a few examples putting my best foot forward. I have many other scripts that i have written, with the best ones out in front. There are several that are less pretty, but these are all personal projects that i made for myself.
I do not share these publically; these are for my own practice in coding, to learn based on the needs i find.. plus, robots are expensive to build.
