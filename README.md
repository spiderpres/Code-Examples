a few examples putting my best foot forward. I have many other scripts that i have written, but they are in various states of progress and did not fully show my knowledge and capabilities. 
my personal include has a few functions i wrote myself, with comments describing their functions and use. 

I do not share these publically; these are for my own practice in coding, to learn based on the needs i find.. plus, robots are expensive to build.
