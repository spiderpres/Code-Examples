a few examples putting my best foot forward, with the best ones out in front. There are several that are less pretty, but these are all personal projects that i made for myself.
I do not share these publically; these are for my own practice in coding, to learn based on the needs i find.. plus, robots are expensive to build.

the vast majority of my work here is based on the SRL include, an open source automation library. i have some experiments with a fork of SRL, called wasplib, 
but i grew up in the SRL community and i am partial for that reason.
